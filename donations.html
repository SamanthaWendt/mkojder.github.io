<h1>Donate</h1>

<p> 
On behalf of the University of Texas Club Tennis Team, we are asking for donations to help fund our team’s expenses for the current season.


<br>Texas Club Tennis is a highly competitive sports club with skilled players. We’re always looking for more ways to get better, win, and succeed. As students of the University of Texas, we are all dedicated to our education, with students in widely diverse fields of study, but we all share a common love for tennis. However, our largest obstacle for the upcoming season is the recent demolition and renewal of our practice courts at the IM fields, in which these new courts have been devoted to UT’s varsity tennis team. While this is great for our school’s varsity players, the Club Tennis Team has suffered. This decrease in tennis courts means there will be no tournaments held in Austin this year, which means our team will have to expend more money toward travel costs such as gas and hotel rooms.


<br>As a competitive team we are hoping to uphold the legacy of Texas Club Tennis: 2008 National Champions, 2013 Sectional Champions, and most recently 2014 Section Runner-Ups. We plan to continue the tradition of longhorns fighting to win. As an alumni who took part in this legacy, surely you remember the fun but competitive edge Texas Club Tennis has on the court. However, in order to do this, we need financial assistance to help us travel across the state.


<br>We hope you will consider giving back to the club. Should you decide to make a donation, we would be honored to recognize your action on our website as a thank you. We invite you to come watch us to practice at UT’s IM tennis courts on Tuesdays and Fridays 6-8 p.m., as well as Sundays 3-5 p.m. Or, bring your racquet and join the Texas Club Tennis experience!


<br>If you would like to donate to us please go <a href = "https://utdirect.utexas.edu/apps/utgiving/online/nlogon/?menu1=LCLL">here</a>. Select "Other" under "Gift Area" and enter Club Tennis in the comment fields. Thank you
