				<h1>UT Club Tennis</h1>
				<p>Texas Club Tennis at the University of Texas at Austin is a licensed recreational sports organization that promotes the sport of tennis throughout the UT community and brings together all levels of players to practice and compete against other University club teams around the state of Texas and across the nation.

<br><br>We fall under the umbrella of the United States' Tennis Association's Tennis on Campus collegiate program. This division sprung from the need for a bridge between junior and adult tennis for those not playing varsity college tennis and has grown immensely since its inception over ten years ago. For more information visit <a href="http://www.tennisoncampus.com">Tennis on Campus</a>.

The Texas Club Tennis team has a rich history of participation and strong results at the sectional and national levels.<br><br> Some of our accolades include:<br>
2008 National Champions<br>
2012 Spring Invitationals Runner-up<br>
2013 Sectional Champions<br>
2014 Sectional Runner-ups<br>
And various other wins in Tennis on Campus regional events.<br>

<br></b><br>We participate in many regional events across the state, a sectionals championship, and send teams to the National Championship and Invitational Tournaments every year.

With each year we grow as an organization and are adding new and exciting things to our club. We are looking to expand and make a name as the largest and most respected sports club on the UT campus.

<br><br>In addition, there are numerous social opportunities afforded by Texas Club Tennis. We hold socials, volunteer events, and various other events that serve to foster a sense of camaraderie. People make life-long friendships through club tennis, and we really strive to create a casual, friendly environment while still making tennis a big priority.

If you are interested in Texas Club Tennis we will be tabling various places around campus and at Party on the Plaza during the fall semester. In addition, you can check out our website <a href="http://www.utclubtennis.com">here</a>. If you have any questions, feel free to email us at: uttennisclub@gmail.com and we will try to respond as soon as possible.

<br><br>Thanks and Hook'em!
